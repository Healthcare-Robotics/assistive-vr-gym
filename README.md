# Assistive VR Gym

Assistive VR Gym (AVR Gym) is a virtual reality framework that enables real people to interact with virtual assistive robots through physics simulation.

With virtual reality, simulation-trained assistive robots can be evaluated with real human motion/actions without putting real people at risk.
In doing so, VR can help bridge the gap between simulations and the real world.
AVR Gym is built on [Assistive Gym](https://github.com/Healthcare-Robotics/assistive-gym), a physics-based simulation framework for physical human-robot interaction and robotic assistance.
